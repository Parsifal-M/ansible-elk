# Ansible-ELK

Installs ELK and other cools ELK related things.

# Requirements

Please install, on the host which will be running the playbooks:

- ansible-galaxy install elastic.elasticsearch,v7.16.0
- ansible-galaxy install geerlingguy.filebeat
- ansible-galaxy install geerlingguy.kibana
- ansible-galaxy install geerlingguy.logstash


## Getting started

Can be forked from:

- https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-role-filebeat
- https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-role-logstash
- https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-role-kibana
- https://github.com/elastic/ansible-elasticsearch 

### Generating a Self-signed certificate

For utmost security, you should use your own valid certificate and keyfile, and update the logstash_ssl_* variables in your playbook to use your certificate.
To generate a self-signed certificate/key pair, you can use use the command:

```openssl req -x509 -batch -nodes -days 3650 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout logstash.key -out logstash.crt -subj '/CN=example.com'```

Note that Filebeat and Logstash may not work correctly with self-signed certificates unless you also have the full chain of trust (including the Certificate Authority for your self-signed cert) added on your server. See: https://github.com/elastic/logstash/issues/4926#issuecomment-203936891

Newer versions of Filebeat and Logstash also require a pkcs8-formatted private key, which can be generated by converting the key generated earlier, e.g.:

```openssl pkcs8 -in logstash.key -topk8 -nocrypt -out logstash.p8```

### Another way of generating the certificates

Follow this link for another guide on how to create the certificates:

https://www.elastic.co/blog/configuring-ssl-tls-and-https-to-secure-elasticsearch-kibana-beats-and-logstash#create-ssl

Once you have generated the certificates, you will need to fill out the playbooks accordingly.

# Roadmap and improvements

A few improvements could be made to the playbooks:

- `30-elasticsearch-output.conf` has to be renamed (or just remove it) to .conf.old otherwise we will get some errors. We keep the input and output in the `01-beats-input.conf` file as such, for this we need to edit the Logstash playbook settings as they are generated based on values given in the playbook.

```
input {
  beats {
    port => 5044
    client_inactivity_timeout => 300
    ssl => true
    ssl_certificate => "/etc/pki/logstash/logstash.crt"
    ssl_key => "/etc/pki/logstash/logstash.pkcs8.key"
    ssl_verify_mode => "none"
    ssl_certificate_authorities => ["/etc/logstash/ca.crt"]
  }
}

output {
  elasticsearch {
    hosts => ["https://localhost:9200"]
    index => "%{[@metadata][beat]}-%{+YYYY.MM.dd}"
    ssl => true
    ssl_certificate_verification => false
    cacert => "/etc/logstash/ca.crt"
    user => 'logstash_writer'
    password => 'blahblahpassword'
  }
}
```
